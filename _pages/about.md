I'm now a PhD candidate (since 2021 fall) in City University of Hong Kong, with the research interests in machine learning and computational biology. I obtained the BS degree from Zhejiang University majoring in Physics and MS degree from University of California, San Diego (UCSD) majoring in ECE in 2019 and 2021 respectively. <br />

A little bit of myself: I grew up in Shenzhen, a wonderful city in China. Playing the violin and sports are used to be my daily routine before my undergraduate study and I have earned the Level 10 Certification of Violin at my early age. I'm a life-long lover of the video game “Fantasy Westward Journey” (梦幻西游). Welcome to my [BiliBili channel!](https://space.bilibili.com/484406122?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0). I got married to [Pingping Zhang](https://ppingzhang.github.io/) at Dec. 2022. She works on image and video compression. <br />
