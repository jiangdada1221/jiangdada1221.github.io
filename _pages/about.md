I will obtain my PhD degree from the City University of Hong Kong in the comming months, specializing in computer science. My research primarily focuses on the development of computational tools for T-cell immunity and cancer immunology. Previously, I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics from Zhejiang University in 2019, followed by a Master of Science degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in 2021. <br />

<!-- A little bit of myself: I grew up in Shenzhen, a wonderful city in China. Playing the violin and sports are used to be my daily routine before my undergraduate study and I have earned the Level 10 Certification of Violin at my early age. I'm a life-long lover of the video game “Fantasy Westward Journey” (梦幻西游). Welcome to my [BiliBili channel!](https://space.bilibili.com/484406122?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0). <br /> -->
