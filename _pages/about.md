<!-- 我出生在江西丰城（1997），成长在深圳市，南山区，在深圳完成了义务教育。喜欢古典乐和流行乐，从小学习小提琴，师从于国家一级演奏员吴经齐先生，并在2014-2015年间有幸得到姜凌老师指导，在13岁时获得了小提琴的十级证书，曾获深圳弘文时声杯杯小提琴一等奖（2010，少年组），浙江省小提琴比赛青年组三等奖（2015，专业比赛），同时我也很喜欢听周杰伦，许嵩，邓紫棋的歌。从小便开始玩《梦幻西游》（2006），一入梦幻已十六年，至今仍无比喜欢着这款童年游戏([我的梦幻图鉴](https://jiangdada1221.github.io/files/menghuan.pdf))。 我于2019年和2021年获得了理学学士（浙江大学）和理学硕士（UCSD）， 从2021年秋博士入学香港城市大学（计算机科学), 目前研究方向为机器学习，计算生物。
<br /> <br /> -->
I'm now a PhD candidate (since 2021 fall) in City University of Hong Kong, with the research interests in machine learning and computational biology. I obtained the BS degree from Zhejiang University majoring in Physics and MS degree from University of California, San Diego (UCSD) majoring in ECE in 2019 and 2021 respectively. <br />

A little bit of myself: I grew up in Shenzhen, a wonderful city in China. Playing the violin and sports are used to be my daily routine before my undergraduate study and I have earned the Level 10 Certification of Violin at my early age. I'm a life-long lover of the video game “Fantasy Westward Journey” (梦幻西游). Welcome to my [BiliBili channel!](https://space.bilibili.com/484406122?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0). I got married to [Pingping Zhang](https://ppingzhang.github.io) at Dec. 2022. She works on video compression. <br />

<!-- __Thank You__ List <br />
I would like to appreciate the following friends for helping me become what I wish to be. <br />
Jiyang Li, my childhood friend. <br />
Jinjie Zeng, my middle school classmate, always support me with no condition <br />
Zao Yin, my high school classmate, without too much talks, I know you're a really good friend to me <br />
Chongxin Run, my classmate in Zhejiang University, physics department, I wish I could have known you earlier. <br />
Lingfeng Wei and Jiangeng Dong, two 大佬 from Chu Kochen Honors College, Zhejiang University, we live together for 1.5 years. #1116-CA92122-LaScala, the memory will last forever to me. <br />
Haoming Zhang, Yuting Jiang, and Jiajun Du, my schoolmates at UCSD, help me go through the tough time when I first came to USA. I really appreciate that. <br />
Yunhao Gou and Bowen Zhang, two colleages when I'm in Sustech, Shenzhen. Though the time we spent together is less than 2 months, maybe I have more conversations with them than most other people appeared in my life. <br /> -->
