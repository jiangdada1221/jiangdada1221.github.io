Hi, I'm Yuepeng Jiang. I have obtained my PhD degree from the City University of Hong Kong, specializing in computer science. My research primarily focuses on the development of computational tools for T-cell immunity and cancer immunology. Previously, I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics from Zhejiang University in 2019, followed by a Master of Science degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in 2021. <br />

A little bit of myself: I grew up in Shenzhen, a vibrant city in China, and I currently live in both Shenzhen and Hong Kong. I'm a life-long lover of the video game “Fantasy Westward Journey” (梦幻西游). If you also play this game and are at level 129, feel free to hit me up!  <br />
